A. How to use my user interface?
- If you click add phong combo button, you can add phong shading to refraction
  you can choose reflect and refract and combination using select render type combo box
  Also, you can choose material incidiences using select material combo box.
  Also, you can adjust your incidiences using slider float
  You can adjust camera pitch and yaw using W, S, A, D and mouse.
  Also can move camera using Up, Down, Left, Right
B. 
- It is can only 64 bits environment, if you click on x86 or 32 bits computer, the application will abort.
  Except this, there are nothing to operate errors.
 
C. Which part of the assignment has been completed
 1. I did sky box renedrng and environment mapping
    Correct environment mapping

 2. I did correct camera setup
    Correct copy texture map
    Correct rendering on environment map on screen 
    Correct  dynamic render targets 
    Correct rendering of skybox and scene with proper use of zbuffer operation
    Correct rendering of textures at the seams of the skybox 

3. Correct loading of the cube map in the shader 
   Correct calculation of the reflection and refraction vectors
   Correct cube side is chosen for sampling 
   Correct calculation of the texture coordinates for sampling textures 

4. Reflection only
   Refraction only
   Fresnel combination of reflection and refraction for 3 wavelengths (R,G,B) 
   Combination with object emissive color
   Change refractive index of object interactively

D. 
- I think I did all thing..

E. 
- obj file is in models folder, source code is in same place and shader files are in shaders folder.
  There are new texture folder. They have textures for sky box.
  include folder has library file 

F. TESELA ROW X, P

G. more than 40 hours.

H. Nothing
